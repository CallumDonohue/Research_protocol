Colors in R
=====================

This is a link to a website that provides a full list of the colours provided by tge R colors() function.
I like this website because it allows you to click on a colour to copy the HEX reference and you can also
convert the HEX values to RGB with an easy to use converter. This is super handy if you need to jump
between MATLAB RGB values and R HEX reference.
