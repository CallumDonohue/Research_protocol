Microsoft PowerToys: Utilities to customize Windows
====================================================

Microsoft PowerToys is a set of utilities for power users to tune and streamline 
their Windows experience for greater productivity. 

It basically installs a bunch of extra utilities on a windows machine to increase functionality so that
you do not need to download a bunch of applications. 
See below, but for example, it downloads a utility which shows the hexcode for any colour you move 
the mouse over, a way to digitise text from images and more effective ways to manipulate/pin windows

Go to the below link to view the utilites and instructions for download (it is worth it):
